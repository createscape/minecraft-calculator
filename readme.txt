A calculator for generating a list of crafting ingredients for Minecraft. 

****Why a Minecraft Calculator****
I was looking for a small project to build while learning javascript in order to absorb some of the concepts and gain some practical experience.  I love Minecraft, and while I saw that there were a few calculators out there already, some of them were outdated or incomplete.  When building something in Minecraft, it can be hard to estimate exactly how many items you will need, and it's nice to have everything ready to go before starting a tutorial or build.  This calculator provides a simple text list that can be copied to a notepad or Word document.  

****Technologies Used****
- Javascript (for the calculator)
- Bulma CSS Framework - https://bulma.io/ - for the UI / Form field styles, etc
- jQuery and jQuery Select2 (for the searchable select fields with icons)
